# Bennett Apps
I'm fifteen years old and I love programming. from robots to mobile apps and video games, I encourage you to check out some of things I've built!

# Unity
I've built several mobile and web games with Unity, a powerful Game Engine. I used the C# programming language alongside Unity to build these projects.

# Mobile Games
These are all projects you can download and try right now on your mobile device from the Apple App Store or Google Play. 

# The Box
Guide your character to the raised exit tunnel, maneuvering through a matrix of moving platforms. Escape before time runs out!

This was the first game I ever saw to completion, start to finish, and published for the world to see. My younger brother was crucial in dreaming up the concepts for this game, and along the way he was able to help out with some of the art and level design. Please, check it out!

# Color Sorter
Sort the falling balls by color in an infinite and increasingly difficult two-dimensional game. Beat your highscore and unlock new colors!

This game is very simple, but it's a great brainless way to kill some time.
